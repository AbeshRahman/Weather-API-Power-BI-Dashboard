# Weather-API-Power-BI-Dashboard

**Project Overview**: 
The Weather Analytics Dashboard is an interactive Power BI report designed to convert live weather data into clear, actionable insights. By integrating real-time data from a Weather API, the dashboard enables users to monitor and analyze weather conditions across locations with ease, accuracy, and visual clarity.

**Purpose & Objective**: 
The primary objective of this project was to demonstrate how API-based data can be ingested, transformed, modeled, and visualized in Power BI. The dashboard focuses on presenting critical weather indicators in a user-friendly format to support quick analysis and informed decision-making.

**Key Insights Delivered**: 
The dashboard highlights essential weather metrics including temperature, humidity, wind speed, atmospheric pressure, and overall weather conditions. Users can interact with slicers and visuals to explore weather patterns dynamically across different locations and time periods.

**Tech Stack**: 
The project was built using Power BI Desktop as the core visualization platform. Power Query (M language) was used for REST API connection, JSON extraction, data cleaning, and transformation. DAX was applied to create calculated measures and ensure responsive, interactive visuals. Proper data modeling techniques were implemented to maintain accuracy and performance.

**Data Integration & Transformation**: 
Live data was pulled directly from a Weather REST API in JSON format. The data was cleaned, expanded, and formatted using Power Query, including column normalization, data type correction, and structuring for analytical use. This ensured reliable filtering and seamless cross-visual interaction.

**Dashboard Features**: 
The report uses cards, charts, slicers, and conditional formatting to enhance readability and usability. The layout is designed with a clean visual hierarchy, allowing users to instantly grasp key weather conditions while still enabling deeper exploration.

**Business & Learning Impact**: 
This project demonstrates real-time analytics capabilities using Power BI and APIs. It reflects practical skills in data integration, transformation, modeling, and dashboard design—skills highly relevant for data analyst and business intelligence roles. The project significantly strengthened my hands-on understanding of API-driven reporting and Power BI best practices.
